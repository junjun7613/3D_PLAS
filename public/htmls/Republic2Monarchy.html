    <h1>From the Republic to the Monarchy&nbsp;</h1>

<div>
    <p>In the middle of the 1st century BC,&nbsp; the Roman state had been facing a radical transformation of its regime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as the civil war between Caesar and his opponents had been over, Caesar became the <em>Dictator Perpetuus</em>, bringing the substantive end of the Roman republic. Caesar, however, was assassinated in 44 BC at the senate and the state plunged into a new civil war, which would finally crush the republic and end up establishing the monarchy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>The final victory fell into the hands of a man called Octavian, later Augustus, in 31 BC. Historians generally regard him as the first emperor of Rome as he gained the unparalleled power and authority that his predecessors had never had and created a new regime no longer a republic, as Ronald Syme, a famous Roman historian, calls it the "Roman Revolution".&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>In such a context, it is quite natural to think that Augustus made much effort to legitimize and justify his regime and to effectively appeal his policy to the people. The construction of the Forum of Augustus would probably be one of the means to achieve that purpose and thus, by analyzing it, we would be able to know much about the thought, attitudes, and character of Augustus himself.&nbsp;</p></div>
